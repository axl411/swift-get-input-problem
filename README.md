# What is this

This is a demo demonstrating that in a subprocess started by a swift program, input from keyboard cannot be captured.

# How to reproduce the problem

```
$ git clone git@github.com:axl411/swift-get-input-problem.git
$ cd swift-get-input-problem
```

1. Open `test.xcodeproj` in Xcode and `cmd + R` to run the program. You will be prompt to enter something. After you entered something (IN XCODE DEBUG TERMINAL), your input will be echoed back, and program ends.
2. Run `./main.swift` in your terminal, do it again, this time your input will not be accepted and the program keeps waiting.

So you have seen the problem. I've also confirmed that even it works in Xcode, it does not work again if I use the binary generated by Xcode and run it in terminal.
